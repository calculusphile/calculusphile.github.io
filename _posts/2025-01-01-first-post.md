This is your first blog post! You can write about your learning journey, project updates, or anything else you'd like to share.

## Getting Started

To create a new blog post, add a new markdown file to the `_posts` directory with the naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`

For example:
- `2025-01-15-learning-c-basics.md`
- `2025-01-20-project-update.md`

Each post should start with YAML front matter like this:

```markdown

Enjoy blogging!
