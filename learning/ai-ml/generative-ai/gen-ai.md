# Introduction to Generative AI

Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems capable of creating new content—such as text, images, code, and audio—based on patterns learned from training data. Unlike traditional AI that focuses on classification or prediction, generative models learn the underlying structure of data to generate novel outputs.

## Key Concepts

- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Neural networks trained on vast text corpora to understand and generate human language
- **Diffusion Models**: Systems that iteratively refine random noise into structured outputs like images
- **Transformers**: Architecture powering most modern generative systems
- **Prompt Engineering**: The art of crafting inputs to guide AI outputs

## Why Learn Generative AI?

Generative AI is reshaping industries through applications like code generation, content creation, automation, and data synthesis. Understanding these technologies is essential for modern software development.
